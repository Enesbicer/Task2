**ðŸš¦ Traffic Sign Recognition API**

This project turns a traffic sign recognition model, previously trained on Google Colab, into a web service using FastAPI.
You can easily run it with Docker and upload an image to find out which traffic sign it is.

**##ðŸ“‚ What Does This Project Do?**

Takes a traffic sign image as input
Processes the image and predicts using a TensorFlow model
Returns the prediction result in JSON format

You need to have the following software installed on your machine:

Docker
Git (optional but recommended)
